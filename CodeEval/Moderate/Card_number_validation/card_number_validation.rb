# To check whether a bank card number is valid or it is it just a set
# of random numbers, Luhn formula is used.
# The formula verifies a number against its included check digit,
# which is usually appended to a partial account number to generate
# the full account number. This account number must pass the following test:
# 1) From the rightmost digit, which is the check digit, moving left,
# double the value of every second digit; if the product of this doubling
# operation is greater than 9 (for example, 7Ã—2=14),
# then sum the digits of the products (for example, 12:1+2=3, 14:1+4=5
# 2) Take the sum of all the digits.
# 3) If the total modulo 10 is equal to 0 (if the total ends in zero) then,
# according to the Luhn formula, the number is valid; otherwise,
# it is not valid.
